                      <p>Provide your plants with the necessary nutrients for optimal growth.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><strong>Organic Fertilizers:</strong> Use organic fertilizers such as compost, fish emulsion, or seaweed extract.</li>
                          <li><strong>Feeding Schedule:</strong> Follow a regular feeding schedule based on the needs of your plants.</li>
                          <li><strong>Avoid Over-Fertilizing:</strong> Too much fertilizer can harm plants and reduce yields.</li>
                      </ul>

                          <li><strong>Regular Inspection:</strong> Check plants regularly for signs of pests or diseases.</li>
                          <li><strong>Natural Remedies:</strong> Use natural pest control methods like neem oil, insecticidal soap, or companion planting.</li>
                          <li><strong>Healthy Practices:</strong> Remove dead or diseased plant material promptly and maintain good air circulation.</li>
                      </ul>

                      <p>Harvest your produce at the right time for the best flavor and quality.</p>
                      <ul>
                          <li><strong>Timing:</strong> Harvest vegetables and herbs when they are ripe and ready to use.</li>
                          <li><strong>Technique:</strong> Use clean, sharp scissors or garden shears to avoid damaging plants.</li>
                          <li><strong>Continuous Harvesting:</strong> Some plants, like lettuce and herbs, benefit from regular harvesting to encourage new growth.</li>
                      </ul>

                          <li><strong>Microgreens:</strong> Grow microgreens on your kitchen counter for a quick and nutritious addition to meals.</li>
                      </ul>
              
                      <h2>Sustainable Practices for Urban Gardening</h2>
                      <h3>Composting</h3>
                      <p>Composting kitchen scraps and garden waste is an excellent way to create nutrient-rich soil for your garden.</p>
