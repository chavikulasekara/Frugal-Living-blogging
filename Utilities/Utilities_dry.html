                        <h3>1. Refresh Your Walls with Paint</h3>
                        <p>Painting is one of the most cost-effective ways to transform a room. A fresh coat of paint can instantly brighten up a space and give it a new look.</p>

                            <li><strong>Prep Properly:</strong> Clean the walls and repair any holes or cracks before painting. Use painter's tape to protect trim and edges for a clean finish.</li>

                            <li><strong>Reclaimed Wood Shelves:</strong> Use reclaimed wood for a rustic and eco-friendly shelving option. Sand and stain the wood to match your style and attach it to the wall with brackets.</li>
                            <li><strong>Corner Shelves:</strong> Utilize corner spaces by installing corner shelves. These can be particularly useful in small apartments where every inch of space counts.</li>

                            <li><strong>Easy Installation:</strong> Clean the surface thoroughly before applying the tiles. Measure and cut the tiles to fit, then peel off the backing and stick them in place.</li>
